<h2>GNU Java Training Wheels</h2>

<p>Java Training wheels (J.T.W.) is a pre-processor for the Java language,
adding such features as a superfor macro, file inclusion,
<b>begin</b>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<b>end</b> instead of {&nbsp;...&nbsp;},
<b>beginMain</b> and <b>endMain</b> as a replacement for public static void
main(String[]&nbsp;args) {&nbsp;...&nbsp;}, and new keywords <b>function</b>,
<b>method</b>, <b>property</b>, <b>constructor</b>, <b>classVar</b>,
<b>var</b>, <b>then</b>, <b>elseif</b>, <b>and</b> and <b>or</b>.</p>

<p>It was written for the sole purpose of making it easier to
learn to program in Java.  The J.T.W. language has a similar syntax to
Delphi, Pascal, BASIC and JavaScript and therefore learning J.T.W.
before or while learning Java provides a less steep learning curve than
learning Java from scratch. <a href="http://davin.50webs.com/J.T.W/">More
